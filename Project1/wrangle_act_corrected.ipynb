    "> For the questions posed, I applied analytical thinking with the aid of visualizations to answer the questions sufficiently.\n",
    "\n",
    "> For the first question, **How does the retweet count relate with the favorite count?**, I used a scatterplot and histogram to answer this question. The scatterplot showed that there is a positive correlation between the retweet and favorite counts. Therefore, it is clear from the scatterplot that tweet retweets increases as favorite counts increases. And from the histogram, it is clear that the count of favorites is greater than that of retweets.\n",
    "\n",
    "> For the second question, ** Which device is used mostly for interactions on the Twitter page in question**, it is clear from the bar-chart that most interactions about dogs is done on twitter using an iphone.\n",
    "\n",
    "> For the third question, **What is the most popular slang name for dogs that are posted by the @dog_rates user.** A bar chart is also used to categorize and show the frequency of the dog slang names used by this user, and it is very clear that pupper is the most frequently used dog slang. This also signifies that there are more puppers than any other dog types, that have been posted by the [@dog_rates](https://twitter.com/dog_rates) user.\n",
    "\n",
    "> When working on this project i faced multiple issues that slowed down my pace and also served as blockades of progress. Firstly, I wasn't granted authorization for using twitter's API after days of applying. Although I couldn't apply my API collection skills on this project, I practiced using my acquired skills on the wikimedia API. I had issues reading the json file into my local notebook, but i read a documentation online for rectifying this issue. And finally, due to inability of this workspace to display the entirety of the data frames being used in this analysis, some columns were collapsed and certain contents weren’t accessible visually, while using the info function. I had to opt to using the loc function to see individual column values to have an idea of the way data was organized in the affected columns and assess if these contents had any issues that needed cleaning."
